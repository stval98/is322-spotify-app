IS 322 Final Project
=====================

In this assignment you will be tasked with creating a web or mobile application using React and
Redux as well as any other tools or libraries we’ve learned throughout the semester.
This assignment should be written using React and JSX, as well as other libraries like Redux and
React-Router-Dom. I recommend using create-react-app as a basis for the application (see
Setting up React Video in Moodle). This project needs to connect to some kind of API, you can
use a mock server as in Project 2 (see JSON Server Tutorial Video in Moodle) or a 3rd party API
(Twitter, YouTube, OpenWeatherMap, etc). You do not need a full custom back-end component
for this assignment.

There are a few options for the project summarized below:

Option 3: Something Else - SPOTIFY APP
--
This option is for students that want to do something interesting in React/Redux that doesn’t
exactly meet the specifications of Option 2 (Custom Application with Requirements). These
projects will need to be cleared by me first, but feel free to ask if you have something in mind.
Keep in mind this is a replacement for the final project, and as a result should be complex and
interesting enough to warrant replacing Option 1 or Option 2.

***IMPORTANT INFORMATION***
--
To properly use this application:
1. cd to `client` directory
2. run `npm start`
3. open a new terminal (while keeping the other open)
4. cd to `auth-server`
5. run `node app.js`
6. click `Now Playing` tab
7. login to spotify
8. play a song on spotify (on another tab/device)
9. check what's playing!

**Description**

This option by it’s very nature doesn’t really have requirements. If you have a React/Redux project you
feel is interesting and complex enough to justify being a final project, talk to me and we can work out
what exactly you need to do.

**General Requirements for All Options**
1. All code must be in GitHub by the due date. Anything later will be disregarded.
2. Apps do not need to be deployed to AFS or another server, though they can be for extra
credit (see Building and Deploying a React App video in Moodle)
3. All pages should be responsive, and can be easily viewed on the following resolutions,
you do not need to specifically code for these resolutions, these are just the ones I will
be testing.
    1. See Media Queries Video in Moodle
    2. 1366px Width (Large Desktop)
    3. 1024px Width (Small Desktop)
    4. 768px Width (Tablet)
    5. 411px Width (Phone)
4. Styling and UI Design WILL COUNT for 20% of the final project grade. I will less be giving points for good design, and less be taking off points for bad design. Doesn’t need to be great, just make it look somewhat good and functional on all resolutions.

**Important:**
1. Track changes to your code using GitHub
2. Submit your GitHub link to the app on Moodle, if you missed one of them, you get 20% off
from full credit.
3. ***NO LATE PROJECTS***
4. You will receive a grade for the project as a whole, and an individual grade for your
contributions.
